<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Most of our teammates are international students from China and Korea. We found an article that the number of international students in the US unprecedentedly still increased during 2019to 2021. Widespread travel restrictions do not appear to have had a large impact on freshmen applying to U.S. universities from outside the U.S. We wanted to see what influences international students to choose certain institutions in the United States.</p>
<p>One of our teammates, Yawei suggested that the top three considerations were: safety, ranking of the university in my field, and the “dynamics” of the campus. The percentage of the international student body would fall under the third category. However, while there has been quite convenient data on the first two categories, the judgment of the third was more based on gut or anecdotes. The rankings on US News, for example, are a weighted composite score of many aspects, but we were not sure whether the international student body is one of the criteria (probably not, but I believe there is correlation there). Therefore, we considered that we could explore more about this potential correlation (x=% of international students, y=rankings) while trying to add in other interesting and relevant information, such as the nationalities of international students, crime rate of the city, etc</p>
<p>The “main” research question is to explore the relationship between percentage of international student population (x-axis) and the ranking of US universities (y-axis). We can then add more interesting complexities/layers to the basic graph through “group_by”, “color”, “fill”, “facet” and different “geoms_plots” using variables such as nationalities, number of (top xx) universities in the city, crime rates of the city, location of the university (on a US map), and ranking type (e.g., undergraduate, graduate cs, graduate education, graduate business, graduate law).</p>
<p>We also wanted to answer the questions below:
How has the number of international students in the US changed over time? (x= school years, y= international students’ population)
New enrollment percentage of international students (x= school years, y= international students’ population % change)
How do new enrollment trends vary by academic level?
Breakdown of international students by the US region they live (2021 vs 2016)</p>
</div>
<div id="breadth-and-depth-of-da" class="section level2">
<h2>Breadth and Depth of DA</h2>
<p>Our group’s target variables are the international student population (ISPo) and proportion (ISPr) in US colleges, and we aim to identify the potential factors that correlate to and predict ISPo and ISPr.</p>
</div>
<div id="early-data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Early Data Analysis</h2>
<p>In our earlier data analysis (Blog Post 4), we examined the relationship between the dependent variable ISPr and the independent variable, an additive indicator reflecting the number of “Alumni of an institution winning Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals” and “Papers indexed in Science Citation Index-Expanded and Social Science Citation Index”. We did this by making predictions with 7 regression models (logistic, quasipolynomial, Gaussian, Poisson, Inverse Gaussian, Gamma) after shuffling and splitting the data with a 70-30 ratio for the train and test sets. By evaluating the AIC and fisher score, we selected the inverse gaussian glm as the best fit of all 7 models. Below we display our linear regression, logistic regression, and inverse gaussian regression.<br />
<br>
One main limitation is that we naively selected one feature, a linear combination of variables on notable alumni with high research and publications, for modelling. Below in the Feature Extraction section, we remedy this problem by experimenting on all predictor variables to select the most promising features to be learned.<br />
<br>
Another main limitation is that we have missing and incorrect data over 300 observations. In particular, we had issues with variables city, state, city_population, city_population_density. We resolved this by imputing the missing values and manually correcting by using US Census and universities’ published data as discussed in our Data Page.</p>
</div>
<div id="feature-extraction" class="section level2">
<h2>Feature Extraction</h2>
<p>We extract the most significant independent variables to improve model performance using two methods:
correlation matrix for continuous predictors and logistic regression for categorical predictors.<br />
<br>
Since we are solving a regression problem, our output is a continuous variable. After data cleaning, we have 35 independent variables concerning every observed college. They are split into 20 continuous variables and 15 categorical variables.</p>
<div id="continuous-predictors" class="section level3">
<h3>Continuous Predictors</h3>
<p>To explore continuous variables’ correlations with the target variables, we have used a correlation matrix.
<img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" />
We identified pairs of variables with high positive or negative correlations and selected numerical features that have an absolute value of correlation coefficient greater than 0.4 with respect to ISPo and ISPr.</p>
<div id="for-ispo-the-relevant-numerical-features-are" class="section level4">
<h4>For ISPo, the relevant numerical features are:</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

</div>
</div>
<div id="categorical-predictors" class="section level3">
<h3>Categorical Predictors</h3>
<p><b>Note</b>: Before using logistic regression, we omit variable “university” because it is unique for all observations.<br />
<br>
We build logistic regression models with single categorical variable predictors and pairs of categorical variable predictors. For readability, we omit the models with paired predictors. However, we document all performances in the R code block. We select variables from models using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) metric.</p>

<h1>Flaws and limitations</h1>
<div id="limitation-1." class="section level3">
<h3>Limitation 1.</h3>
<p>One of the main limitations is that for our models we don’t introduce any categorical variables. We address this in the Feature Extraction section.
Alternatively, we are interested in leveraging the regsubsets subroutine in the leaps library to compare modeling with different variables, which provides performance criteria such as Adjusted R2 score, Bayesian Information Criterion, Mallow’s Cp.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitation-2." class="section level3">
<h3>Limitation 2.</h3>
<p>On the other hand, due to the sparsity of the data, if we include certain predictors, the overall data for training and testing may shrink to 10 observations, which leads to not unreliable modeling and predictions.</p>
