This comes from the file `content/big_picture.Rmd`.

Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Importantly, these should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: On this page

You will



* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-baity title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible).
* Quality of Figures
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `echo=FALSE`.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

Our Interactive dashboard has two components. The [first](link) is an overview of the scope of our dataset. The [second](link) is a tool to explore the relationship between our outcome variables and each individual predictor variable. 

<br>

The creation of the first interactive component is to make it more transparent about the scope and limitation of our dataset to users. According to a post on [BestColleges](https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/how-many-colleges-in-us/), there are nearly 6,000 colleges and universities in the U.S.. However, our dataset was only able to cover 441 of them. As introduced in the Data Page[link], our final dataset came from nine different sources and only universities which had data on international student population (either number of percentage, or both) were retained. We also present our cleaned dataset in a table with outcome filter to display universities with available data on number of international students, with available data on percentage of international students, or with available data on both. Users can also sort variables depending on interest.

<br>

The second component is to encourage users to explore the relationship between our outcome variables and each individual predictor variable. Users will first choose between number of international students and percentage of international students as an outcome, and then choose among xx predictor variables one at a time. The “Plot” tab will display a box plot if choosing categorical variables or a scatter plot with fitted line if choosing continuous variables. The “Linear Regression Model Summary” tab will print the model summary, which will include information on variable coefficients, p-value, and number of observations.



### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site. 

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
