## Choosing A University -- A Personal Story of Linshen

The decision of a university is basically a four-year way of life. How fortunate is it that your desired school made you an offer in the first decision letter of the application season!

<br>

I had two distinct objectives when I first started making my list of universities to apply to: one was to get a high ranking, and the other was to get a good academic assessment. I believe that my previous education was insufficient and superficial, and I believe that institutions with better academic standards can provide 20-year-olds an opportunity to establish a strong foundation. It is preferable to say that we are learning a way of thinking rather than simply acquiring knowledge, and this style of thinking may provide people depth and inspiration in their future endeavors, whether they be in education, employment, or general life. It is said that giving someone a fish is preferable to teaching them how to fish.

<br>

The school planned a four-day college excursion for the 11th graders. Even if I didn't find any favorites after visiting seven or eight institutions, I can tell that each one has an own flair. The journey's conclusion is that picking a university involves choose a way of life for the following four years. Lifestyle, in my opinion, is intimately tied to a school's ethos, my own expectations of myself, and my own flaws.


<br>

Due to Boston University's superior achievement in this ongoing epidemic as compared to other colleges, I took the initiative to contact Boston University through online classes during the eleventh grade summer break. Following the cancellation of the offline summer school, Boston University immediately began offering a number of online courses. Boston University's dashboard is wonderfully designed, completely functional, and rich in diversity in an atmosphere where the attitude of online courses is exploding; the teachers' courses are acceptable and have an interactivity that is lacking in typical online courses. In a nutshell, the game experience is fantastic. Additionally, because so many Boston University students are enrolled in these courses, you may observe the actual classroom environment.The ferocity of the big men' speeches has often taken my breath away. The two factors I just mentioned have increased my support for Boston University by double. As of right now, I consider myself fortunate to have first chosen Boston University.

## Background -- Has the epidemic affected the status of American universities in the hearts of international students?

The United States is recognized as the country with the highest quality of education in the world. This has attracted many students from other countries to study in the United States. During the epidemic, many students have temporarily adjusted their study abroad plans. But the epidemic did not stop the attractiveness of prestigious schools in the slightest.

```

As we can see from both table based on open door report and graph , from the 2019-2020 academic year to the 2020-2021 academic year, the number of international students in American universities has experienced a large decline as much as 15% compared to last academic year. As for the reason, the person in charge of the Open Door Report analyzed that it was mainly because the epidemic affected going abroad, but American colleges and universities believed that it was a policy restriction issue such as General Order No. 10043, that is, a series of visa restrictions on students studying in sensitive majors in the United States. In the academic year of 2021-2022, there are 958,000 international students studying in the U.S. This is an increase of 3.8% compared to last academic year.The trend shows that after the epidemic, the number of international students studying in the United States has rebounded significantly. The person in charge of international admissions at a university in the United States said: Because of the epidemic, it will take some time to truly return to the previous situation. But the increase in numbers is a good sign.

<br>

The majority of international candidates are from China, which is their country of origin. India, Canada, Pakistan, and Nigeria come next. Chinese and Indian students made up 53% of all foreign students enrolled in American universities, according to the Institute of International Education's most recent "2021 American Open Doors Report." Chinese students will make up 317,000 students in the 2020–2021 academic year, or 35% of all foreign students enrolled in American schools.

<br>

So, What then determines the quantity of overseas students? What criteria do foreign students use to select a university?

<br>


## What does our website provide? What's our thesis?

We were extremely startled to see that there are a lot of unanticipated indications that are associated to foreign students' decision to attend a certain institution, such as safety, the university's standing in the area, and the campus's "dynamics." It also depends on a number of other factors, such as tuition, the student-to-teacher ratio, city population, and the research output factor. By offering some information on universities, this website should be useful to individuals, especially those who plan to study abroad in the future.

<br>

Our argument is that the percentage of overseas students at a US institution increases with the university's rating. From our analysis, it is also clear that the number of international students studying in the United States is rising steadily in line with recent data excluding the decline in the 2019-2022 school year due to the epidemic and other reasons. At the same time,for relevant numerical factor, there is a correlation between the city population where the university is located and the percentage of international students. For relevant categorical factor, The Proportion of international students in the university correlates with world rank of the university.


<br>
```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caTools)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(reshape2)
clean_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/lione/OneDrive/Desktop/ma4615-fa22-final-project-pick_a_university/dataset/prev_data.csv")
ggplot(clean_data)+geom_point(aes(x=city_population_density ,y= international_students_natlib,color='steelblue'))


```


As we can see from graph above,there is a lower positive relation between city population density where university located with the proportion of the international students. It means the proportion of overseas students increases with urban density around the university.


```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caTools)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(reshape2)
read.csv("C:/Users/lione/OneDrive/Desktop/ma4615-fa22-final-project-pick_a_university/dataset/clean_data.csv")
 

ISPo_Cat <- clean_data[c("international_students_max", "research_output_qs","size_qs", "type3_natlib", "type4_carnegie", "world_rank_cat_arwu", "selectivity", "state")] 

data10 <- clean_data[c("international_students_max", "world_rank_cat_arwu")] %>% drop_na()
data10_melt <- melt(data10, id = "world_rank_cat_arwu")


ggplot(data10_melt, aes(reorder(variable,value), y = value, color = factor(world_rank_cat_arwu))) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x=element_blank()) + labs(x = "", y = "ISPo") + scale_color_discrete("world_rank_cat_arwu")

```


From the figure above, the lower the ranking of the university (the larger the number), the lower the average international student population. International students prefer schools with high world rankings. The schools ranked between 51-100 in the world have the largest number of international students on average. Then, as the university's world ranking decreases, the average number of international students in the school also decreases. It is worth noting, however, that schools ranked 21 to 50 in the world have fewer international students on average than schools ranked 51 to 100, due to the lack of data in the category.



## Interactive


Our Interactive dashboard has two components. **The [first](https://d63xhp-zeshi-wu.shinyapps.io/SchoolData/) interactive** is an overview of the scope of our dataset. On the "SchoolMap" tab, users can see the number of universities included in our dataset in each state by hovering the mouse on the states. It is clear that the majority of our dataset are universities in the Northeastern region and four other states: Florida, Texas, California, and Washington. On the "Datatable" tab, users can actually see our dataset. Users can select which variables they want to be displayed and sort them. Our codebook, which is located at the bottom of our [Data Page](https://clever-unicorn-d34bd5.netlify.app/data/), will assist with understanding the meaning of each variable. The Search function on the top right corner will enable users to locate specific universities in our dataset (for example, typing "boston" will display 14 universities which either contains "Boston" in its name or is located in Boston, MA).  

<br>

The creation of the first interactive component is to make it more transparent about the scope and limitation of our dataset to users. According to a post on [BestColleges](https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/how-many-colleges-in-us/), there are nearly 6,000 colleges and universities in the U.S.. However, our dataset was only able to cover 441 of them. As introduced in the Data Page[https://clever-unicorn-d34bd5.netlify.app/data/], our final dataset came from nine different sources and only universities which had data on international student population (either number of percentage, or both) were retained. 

<br>

**The [second](https://b6vqbw-yawei-huang.shinyapps.io/FinalProjectApp/) interactive** is a tool to explore the relationship between our outcome variables and each individual predictor variable.  Users will first choose between number of international students and percentage of international students as an outcome, and then choose one predictor variable included in our dataset. The “Plot” tab will display a scatter plot with crossbar if a categorical predictor is selected or display a a scatter plot with fitted line if a continuous predictor is selected. On the “Linear Regression Model Summary” tab, users will see the coefficient estimates and associated p-value from the bivariate linear regression model. For categorical predictors, the terms are each category (or level); for continuous predictors, the terms are intercept and the predictor selected. In terms of interpretation of coefficient estimate, for categorical predictors it refers to the predicted value of the outcome given the specific category/level; for continuous predictors it refers to the predicted change in value of the outcome given a one unit increase in the selected predictor. Check out our codebook (located at the bottom of our [Data Page](https://clever-unicorn-d34bd5.netlify.app/data/) to understand the meaning and units of each variable.
