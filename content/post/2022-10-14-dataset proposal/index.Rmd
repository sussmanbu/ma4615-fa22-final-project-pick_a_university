Here are the steps you'll need to take. __Please only start this once you have a set team of 4 or 5__.

## Steps for Netlify Setup (only one team member should do this)


To stop previewing the website you can run `blogdown::stop_server()`.

Make sure to frequently check that you don't have any problems with `blogdown::check_site()`. This may give you a hint about something to correct.

Some general guidelines are:

1. Always commit `.Rmd` and `.Rmarkdown` files. Otherwise, your teammates won't be able to see the original R code.
2. Always commit `.md` files.
3. Usually commit `.html` files unless they share a name with a `.md` file.
4. Always commit changes in the `static` folder.

__Never__ commit large (> 50mb) data files. This can cause some challenges.
