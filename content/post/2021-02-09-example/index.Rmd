This file is from `content/post/2021-02-09-example/index.Rmd`. I made it by running `blogdown::new_post("example", ext = ".Rmd")`.

Note that images like the one above are stored in `static/images` in your project folder.

## Just like an RMarkdown

Show code ...


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
msleep %>%
  group_by(vore) %>%
  summarize(`average body weight` = mean(bodywt))
```

<br>

... or a nicer table ...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
msleep %>%
  group_by(vore) %>%
  summarize(`average body weight` = mean(bodywt)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

... or make a plot.

```{r, fig.cap = "Wow captions too!"}
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = sleep_total, y = bodywt)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()
```

I can even put in some math $e^x$ or a displayed equation
$$e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0.$$

# Creating a new post

To create a new post you can run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_post("Post title", ext = ".Rmd")
```

Alternatively, you can use the "Addins" menu.

Just make sure to select `.Rmd` for the format so you can include and run `R` code.
