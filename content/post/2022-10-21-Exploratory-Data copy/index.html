<h2>Steps for Netlify Setup (only one team member should do this)</h2>
<p>To stop previewing the website you can run <code>blogdown::stop_server()</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure to frequently check that you don’t have any problems with <code>blogdown::check_site()</code>. This may give you a hint about something to correct.</p>
<p>Some general guidelines are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Always commit <code>.Rmd</code> and <code>.Rmarkdown</code> files. Otherwise, your teammates won’t be able to see the original R code.</li>
<li>Always commit <code>.md</code> files.</li>
<li>Usually commit <code>.html</code> files unless they share a name with a <code>.md</code> file.</li>
<li>Always commit changes in the <code>static</code> folder.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Never</strong> commit large (&gt; 50mb) data files. This can cause some challenges.</p>
