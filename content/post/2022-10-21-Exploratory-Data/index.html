<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>
This is a dummy template for Blog 2
</p>
  

<p>
We plan to add more data with more features/factors that may influence international student  'permeation' and enrollment (i.e. Selectivity, Carnegie Classification, Public/Private, State political party affiliation, Global mobility data, Geographic regions, etc)
</p>
<br>
<p>
In doing so, we hope we'll find interesting relationships between the above variables and international student population and college rankings. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
We are also interested in other datasets and will look into <a href ="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023" >QSrankings</a>, <a href ="https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/arwu/2022" >ARWU</a>, and many more to come.
