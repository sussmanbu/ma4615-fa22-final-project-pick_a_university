### Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU, from Opendatasoft) 
**Link:** [Opendatasoft](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/shanghai-world-university-ranking/table/?sort=world_rank&refine.country=United+States)


Opendatasoft is a French company which develops tools for sharing and reusing the data of companies and public administrations. The ARWU data we were looking for is one of such datasets provided from Opendatasoft. For the sake of our project, we downloaded the ARWU ranking in 2018 (the most recent year available on Opendatasoft) in a .csv file, which contains 139 observations. The variables are University name, World rank, Work rank integer, National rank,and Total score with the Criteria indicators: Alumni, Award, HiCi, N&S, PUB, PCP. Note that we found this alternative data source because data is not directly downloadable from the official ARWU website.



### US News College Rankings (from Kaggle) 
**Link:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neelgajare/2022-usa-college-rankings-more)


This dataset is the US News rankings of the best American universities of undergraduate programs. US News is a recognized leader in college rankings. There are 392 American universities based on their undergraduate programs. We also downloaded it from kaggle. The variables contain College Name, Tuition, Enrollment Number. In this dataset, there are two universities with no tuition data when merging all datasets. Scholars created this dataset to study which colleges are best, and to compare tuitions and enrollment numbers in the US.



### US and Liberal College from (from US News) 
**Link:** [US News](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/most-international)


This dataset is from USNews that describes 145 American universities in 2022 with top proportions of international students, which was collected for publishing consumer advice, rankings, and relevant analysis. USNews is a very sourceful website commonly used by students for collecting and comparing universities’ information. We were able to do web scraping and generate the csv file for the dataset. Essentially, this data has 145 rows with 3 columns with School name, location, and percentage of international students, sorted by descending percentage.



### International Student Leading Institutes (from Opendoors) 
**Link:** [Opendoors](https://opendoorsdata.org/data/international-students/leading-institutions/)


Opendoors has been regarded as the comprehensive information resource on international students and scholars in the United States and on US students studying abroad. The dataset shows the view of the leading institutions hosting international students in the United States with the institution name and the number of international students.



### Carnegie Classification Data
**Link:** [Carnegie Classification](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/classification_descriptions/basic.php)


The Carnegie Classification® is been the prominent framework that captures the institutional diversity in U.S. post secondary insitutions for over the past 45 years.  The Carnegie dataset contained over 50 different features, but we selectively chose the 8 features: University Name, City, State, Carnegie Basic Classification, Size and Setting Classification, Control of institution, Enrollment Profile Classification, Degree of urbanization.



### QS World and National Rankings (from Kaggle)
**Link:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/padhmam/qs-world-university-rankings-2017-2022)


The source of this data set comes from the QS World University Rankings, which is the annual university rankings published by Quacquarelli Symonds, and is viewed as one of the three most-widely read university rankings in the world. We found it on kaggle and it can be downloaded through the website. Kaggle is a data modeling and data analysis platform. Companies and researchers can publish and analyze data on it. This dataset contains basic information of 1368 universities around the world and their rankings from 2017 to 2022. This dataset was created to study factors that affect university rankings, what makes a good university. For our project, we used data from the most recent year (i.e., 2022).



### Selectivity (from College Transitions)
**Link:** [College Transitions](https://www.collegetransitions.com/college-selectivity/)


The data is not downloadable but instead we copied and pasted the table to excel sheets from the website. There are four categories for selectivity: most selective, extreme selective, very selective, moderately selective. College Transitions is a team of college planning experts committed to guiding students and families through the application process.From the source in College Transitions website, we found the college selectivity matters for members of non-dominant class(no white, wealthy, and well-educated) earned significantly more than similarly qualified students with same background who attended less exclusive schools.



### Enrollment of the 120 Largest Degree-granting College (from NCES)
**Link:** [NCES Dataset](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_312.10.asp)


The data is sourced from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which is an essential component of the United States Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences that publishes statistics on education and public school district finance information in the United States. This Enrollment Dataset has 120 college observations and 6 columns describing institution name, state, rank, control (public, private-nonprofit, private-profit), level (4 year, 2 year), and total enrollment size.



### City Population and Density
**Link:** [Governing Dataset](https://www.governing.com/archive/population-density-land-area-cities-map.html)


The dataset is not downloadable but they have all the data from on the website. Instead, we just copy and paste the data from the website to form a dataset. The data of the Governing website is originally from [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/), which is an official website from US government that measure america’ s people, place and economy. It includes City, Population Density (Persons/Square Mile), 2016 Population and Land Area (Square Miles) important variables.





## Data Cleaning


As described above, we gathered data from nine different sources. In this section, we discussed and presented how we cleaned each data subset in preparation for joining, how we joined all data subsets together, and how we continued to tidy the joined full data set.



### Initial Cleaning


Our initial data cleaning for each data subset included loading each data set, checking for problems, as well as selecting, arranging, and renaming relevant variables.

### Joining eight out of nine data subsets, followed by some cleaning


After some basic cleaning presented above, we first did a full join of the seven out of nine data sets (excluding the Carnegie Classification data and population density data), which was then left joined with the Carnegie Classification data. 



```{r}
full_data_leftjoinCarnegie <- arwu2018 %>% 
  full_join(kagglecolleges, by = "university") %>% 
  full_join(nat_lib_uscolleges, by = "university") %>% 
  full_join(opendoors_2021SY, by = "university") %>% 
  full_join(qs2022, by = "university") %>% 
  full_join(selectivity, by = "university") %>% 
  full_join(top120enrollment2020fall, by = "university") %>% 
  left_join(p1_carnegie, by = "university") 

write_csv(full_data_leftjoinCarnegie, file = here::here("dataset/full_data_leftjoinCarnegie.csv"))
```



For variables that had multiple columns due to coming from different data sources, such as city and state, we aggregated the information to one column. Initially, The left joined data set had 961 observations, with each row representing a university. Our outcome of interest, international student population, had three datapoints: the percentage in 2021 from US news, the actual number in 2021 from opendoors, and actual number from 2022 from QS but downloaded from Kaggle. We further filtered the dataset to universities which had at least one datapoint out of these three, which resulted in 499 observations. We saved the updated dataset.



```{r}
## Turn type1_top120enrollment and type1_qs into numeric variable
full_data_leftjoinCarnegie <- full_data_leftjoinCarnegie %>% 
  mutate(type1_top120enrollment = ifelse(type1_top120enrollment=="Public", 1, type1_top120enrollment)) %>%
  mutate(type1_top120enrollment = ifelse(type1_top120enrollment=="PrivNp", 2, type1_top120enrollment)) %>%
  mutate(type1_top120enrollment = ifelse(type1_top120enrollment=="PrivFp", 3, type1_top120enrollment)) %>%
  mutate(type1_qs = ifelse(type1_qs=="Public", 1, type1_qs)) %>%
  mutate(type1_qs = ifelse(type1_qs=="Private", 4, type1_qs))

full_data_leftjoinCarnegie$type1_top120enrollment <- as.numeric(full_data_leftjoinCarnegie$type1_top120enrollment)
full_data_leftjoinCarnegie$type1_qs <- as.numeric(full_data_leftjoinCarnegie$type1_qs)


## Only keep one city column (there are four after joining) 
full_data_leftjoinCarnegie1 <- full_data_leftjoinCarnegie %>% 
  filter(!is.na(university)) %>% 
  head(-4) %>% 
  relocate(university, city.x, city.y, city.x.x, city.y.y) %>%
  arrange(is.na(city.x)) %>% 
  mutate(city.x = ifelse(is.na(city.x), city.y, city.x)) %>% 
  mutate(city.x = ifelse(is.na(city.x), city.x.x, city.x)) %>% 
  mutate(city.x = ifelse(is.na(city.x), city.y.y, city.x)) %>% 
  arrange(is.na(city.x)) %>% 
  select(-city.y, -city.x.x, -city.y.y) %>% 
  rename(city = city.x) %>% 
## Only keep one state column (there are five after joining)
  relocate(university, city, state, state_natlib, state_opendoors, state_top120enrollment, state_carnegie) %>%
  arrange(is.na(state)) %>% 
  mutate(state = ifelse(is.na(state), state_natlib, state)) %>% 
  mutate(state = ifelse(is.na(state), state_opendoors, state)) %>% 
  mutate(state = ifelse(is.na(state), state_top120enrollment, state)) %>%
  mutate(state = ifelse(is.na(state), state_carnegie, state)) %>%
  arrange(is.na(state)) %>% 
  select(-state_natlib, -state_opendoors, -state_top120enrollment, -state_carnegie) %>% 
## Relocate international students population datapoints (there are three)
  relocate(university, city, state, international_students_natlib, international_students_opendoors, international_students_qs) %>%
## Filter out if data is misisng on international_students_natlib, international_students_qs, or international_students_opendoors
  filter(!is.na(international_students_natlib) | !is.na(international_students_opendoors) | !is.na(international_students_qs)) 

write_csv(full_data_leftjoinCarnegie1, file = here::here("dataset/full_data_leftjoinCarnegie1.csv"))
```



### Some manually cleaning directly in the .csv file

Then, we realized that some universities had multiple observations due to inconsistency use from different sources. For example, Purdue University has three observations: “Purdue University”, “Purdue University–West Lafayette”, and “Purdue University - West Lafayette.” To solve this issue, we exported the dataset to a .csv file, sorted by university name, and manually de-duplicated the dataset. More specifically, we identified those universities with multiple observations, filled the information to all observations, and then deleted the duplicate observations to only keep one row. This procedure resulted in 441 observations (reducing from 499 observations), each of which represent a unique university. We then imported this file ("full_data_leftjoinCarnegie1_dedup.csv") back to R and proceeded to further data cleaning.



```{r}
full_data_leftjoinCarnegie1_dedup <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/full_data_leftjoinCarnegie1_dedup.csv"))

problems(full_data_leftjoinCarnegie1_dedup)
```



### Deeper cleaning with the de-duplicated dataset


This round of deeper cleaning focused on four main areas. First, we combined predictor variables that had multiple data points (such as private or public, 2-year vs 4-year). Second, given that we had two columns (from two sources) on number of international students (which is one of our outcome variables), we combined them by creating a new variable that takes the maximum value of the two original columns. Third, we left joined the dataset with the remaining US city population data, which included variables on the city population, city land area, and city population density in 2016. Fourth, we dealt with the categorical variables, including re-leveling and re-ordering. We also presented a bar plot of these categorical variables after the re-leveling and re-ordering.

Lastly, we created a [codebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LrG_loCoEdJ-xUE09TQ-LT3ccRhfM8fb/edit#gid=260549592) for our dataset.
