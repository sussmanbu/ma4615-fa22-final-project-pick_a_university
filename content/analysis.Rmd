This comes from the file `content/analysis.Rmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
print(getwd())
data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal_clean.csv"))
load(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal.RData"))
print(ls())

## Rubric: On this page

you will


* Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
  * Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
  * What questions are you interested in answering?
* Breadth of the DA
  * Make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.
  * i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?
* Depth of the DA
  * When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well. 
  * The depth of the DA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.
* Modeling and Inference 
  * You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.
  * Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
  * Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
* Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
  * Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? ...
* Clarity Figures
  * Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
  * Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.
* Clarity of Explanations
  * Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?
  * How well do you explain each figure/result?
  * Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
* Organization and cleanliness.
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
  
  
**NOTE**: Your Data Analysis can be broken up into multiple pages if that helps with your organization.
