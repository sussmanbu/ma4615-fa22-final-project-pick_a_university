<h2>Choosing A University – A Personal Story of Linshen</h2>
<p>The decision of a university is basically a four-year way of life. How fortunate is it that your desired school made you an offer in the first decision letter of the application season!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had two distinct objectives when I first started making my list of universities to apply to: one was to get a high ranking, and the other was to get a good academic assessment. I believe that my previous education was insufficient and superficial, and I believe that institutions with better academic standards can provide 20-year-olds an opportunity to establish a strong foundation. It is preferable to say that we are learning a way of thinking rather than simply acquiring knowledge, and this style of thinking may provide people depth and inspiration in their future endeavors, whether they be in education, employment, or general life. It is said that giving someone a fish is preferable to teaching them how to fish.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The school planned a four-day college excursion for the 11th graders. Even if I didn’t find any favorites after visiting seven or eight institutions, I can tell that each one has an own flair. The journey’s conclusion is that picking a university involves choose a way of life for the following four years. Lifestyle, in my opinion, is intimately tied to a school’s ethos, my own expectations of myself, and my own flaws.</p>

<p>Due to Boston University’s superior achievement in this ongoing epidemic as compared to other colleges, I took the initiative to contact Boston University through online classes during the eleventh grade summer break. Following the cancellation of the offline summer school, Boston University immediately began offering a number of online courses. Boston University’s dashboard is wonderfully designed, completely functional, and rich in diversity in an atmosphere where the attitude of online courses is exploding; the teachers’ courses are acceptable and have an interactivity that is lacking in typical online courses. In a nutshell, the game experience is fantastic. Additionally, because so many Boston University students are enrolled in these courses, you may observe the actual classroom environment.The ferocity of the big men’ speeches has often taken my breath away. The two factors I just mentioned have increased my support for Boston University by double. As of right now, I consider myself fortunate to have first chosen Boston University.</p>

<h2>Background – The epidemic has not affected the status of American universities in the hearts of international students</h2>
<p>The most recent revision of The Common App, a mechanism for applying to undergraduate programs at American colleges, was made available for the application year of 2021–2022. A total of 1,106,800 applicants had submitted their applications to American institutions as of January 17, 2022. There were an additional 977,900 persons in the quarter, up 13.2%.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which has been going on for two years, hasn’t had an impact on how overseas students see the United States, based on the volume of applications from them. According to data, 109,300 foreign students applied during this application season, compared to 833,000 during the 2019/2020 application period. Compared to before the outbreak, there are more than 30% more applications from overseas students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The majority of international candidates are from China, which is their country of origin. India, Canada, Pakistan, and Nigeria come next. Chinese and Indian students made up 53% of all foreign students enrolled in American universities, according to the Institute of International Education’s most recent “2021 American Open Doors Report.” Chinese students will make up 317,000 students in the 2020–2021 academic year, or 35% of all foreign students enrolled in American schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What then determines the quantity of overseas students? What criteria do foreign students use to select a university?</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>What does our website provide? What’s our thesis?</h2>
<p>We were extremely startled to see that there are a lot of unanticipated indications that are associated to foreign students’ decision to attend a certain institution, such as safety, the university’s standing in my area, and the campus’s “dynamics.” It also depends on a number of other factors, such as tuition, the student-to-teacher ratio, alumni, and the publishing factor. By offering some information on universities, this website should be useful to individuals, especially those who plan to study abroad in the future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our argument is that the percentage of overseas students at a US institution increases with the university’s rating. From our analysis, it is also clear that the number of international students studying in the United States is rising steadily in line with recent data. At the same time, there is a correlation between the quantity of papers the institution publishes and the percentage of overseas students. It is clear that one of the key factors for international schools is academic standing</p>

<h2>Interactive</h2>
<p>Our Interactive dashboard has two components. The <a href="link">first</a> is an overview of the scope of our dataset. The <a href="link">second</a> is a tool to explore the relationship between our outcome variables and each individual predictor variable.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The creation of the first interactive component is to make it more transparent about the scope and limitation of our dataset to users. According to a post on <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/how-many-colleges-in-us/">BestColleges</a>, there are nearly 6,000 colleges and universities in the U.S.. However, our dataset was only able to cover 441 of them. As introduced in the Data Page[link], our final dataset came from nine different sources and only universities which had data on international student population (either number of percentage, or both) were retained. We also present our cleaned dataset in a table with outcome filter to display universities with available data on number of international students, with available data on percentage of international students, or with available data on both. Users can also sort variables depending on interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The second component is to encourage users to explore the relationship between our outcome variables and each individual predictor variable. Users will first choose between number of international students and percentage of international students as an outcome, and then choose among xx predictor variables one at a time. The “Plot” tab will display a box plot if choosing categorical variables or a scatter plot with fitted line if choosing continuous variables. The “Linear Regression Model Summary” tab will print the model summary, which will include information on variable coefficients, p-value, and number of observations.</p>
